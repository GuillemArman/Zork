{"name":"Zork","tagline":"","body":"# Welcome to my Zork\r\n\r\nHi everyone, \r\nMy name is Guillem Arman and I am studying videogame development, here you can take a look to my first Zork project.\r\nFor all of you who don't know what game is Zork, I give you the link of the original game [here](http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fzcode%2Fzdungeon.z5).\r\n\r\n##  What is Zork?\r\n\r\nZork is a text-based videogame, a genre also known as \"interactive fiction\", whose defining feature is the absence of typical video game graphics. Instead, the game’s environments and the actions you take are described for you. For example, the first line of Zork is, “You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.” Using a series of simple commands, you direct the main character to do something, like “open mailbox.” To which the game will reply, “Opening the small mailbox reveals a leaflet.” Naturally, you would then “take leaflet,” “read leaflet”, and then maybe “walk east” to get to the house. The story unfolds from there as you collect items, like a sword, a lantern, rope, and other adventuring necessities, before entering a vast, underground cave where you’ll face enemies inspired by The Lord of the Rings, like elves, trolls, and the darkness-lurking grue.\r\n\r\n\r\n## My Zork\r\n\r\nHere you can read the background of my game: \r\n\r\nIt’s 8 a.m.\r\nYou have just read in the newspaper that there is a murderer in your town. You leave home because you need some stuff to buy. When you enter the shop you see a suspicious person who buys chloroform. Your goal is to follow him and discover if he is the killer, but remember that it has to happen before 23:00 pm because all the victims die at 24:00.\r\n\r\n(Photo of the map)\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Dc2jPak.jpg","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
